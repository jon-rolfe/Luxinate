###Overview
<p align="center"><small>Work in progress...</small></p>
###Features
A slew of new features have been added to Luxinate since the last release!<br>Check it out!<br>
[_LuxePrisimPackageManager_](https://github.com/Ritashugisha/luxeprisim.dependency.pack)<br>
In order to drastically decrease the download size of Luxinate, _LuxePrisimPackageManager_ has been developed to supply and manage any and all external dependencies required by workflows authored by Ritashugisha.<br><br>
At every runtime of Luxinate, _LuxePrisimPackageManager_ will quickly and silently check if there are missing workflow dependencies. If so, the package manager will grab the missing resources and extract them to their specific locations silently. This results in a 10MB workflow installation being shrunken down to 58KB installation with only a small addition in startup time during initial setup.<br><br>
[_GlyphManager_](https://github.com/Ritashugisha/GlyphManager)<br>
To counter the problem of annoyance concerning Luxinate's glyphs, _GlyphManager_ has been developed and placed at the root of all workflows by Ritashugisha.<br><br>
_GlyphManager_ allows freedom for you to use your preferred theme. Instead of being forced to download a specific version of Luxinate to recieve a set of icons that contrast your theme, _GlyphManager_ will now switch between white and black icons automatically to accomadate your theme preference.<br><br>
[_YouTube-DL_](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)<br>
_YouTube-DL_ has now been improved to the point where Luxinate can now support self updates. This allows for the newest downloading features and supported sites to be pushed automatically to your system.<hr>
